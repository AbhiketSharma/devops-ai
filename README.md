# 🚀 Real-Time AIOps System (DevOps + AI)

This project is a **real-time AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) system**
built using **Python and DevOps concepts**.

It continuously monitors system metrics, detects anomalies, generates alerts,
and performs **auto-healing actions (simulation)** with production-style logic.
